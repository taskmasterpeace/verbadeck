# VerbaDeck AI Enhancement - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## What Was Built

### ✅ OpenRouter AI Integration
- **Server-side API client** with secure key management
- **3 API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/models` - Fetch available AI models
  - `POST /api/process-script` - Process raw text into structured sections
  - `POST /api/suggest-triggers` - AI suggests better trigger words
- **Model support:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama, and 50+ others

### ✅ Model Selector Component
- **Beautiful dropdown UI** with categorized models:
  - Recommended (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo)
  - Cost-Effective (Claude Haiku, GPT-3.5)
  - Premium (Gemini Pro, Claude Sonnet)
- **Persistent selection** (localStorage)
- **Model details:** context length, pricing, descriptions

### ✅ AI Script Processor
- **Paste raw text** → AI formats into presentation sections
- **Loading states** with progress bar (0-100%)
- **Smart parsing:** AI identifies natural section breaks and trigger words
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Character counter** (max 50,000 chars)

### ✅ Rich Section Editor
- **Click-to-select trigger words** - Click any word to make it a trigger
- **Visual highlighting:**
  - Primary trigger: Bold + star (★)
  - Alternative triggers: Highlighted
- **Multi-trigger support** - Set multiple words per section
- **AI suggestions** - "AI Suggest" button for better trigger ideas
- **Inline editing** - Edit section text directly
- **Delete sections** - Remove unwanted sections

### ✅ Visual Transition Effects
- **Framer Motion animations:**
  - Slide transitions (enter from right, exit to left)
  - Flash border effect (green pulse on advance)
  - Smooth opacity fades
- **Configurable intensity** (subtle/standard/dramatic)
- **Visual cues** when sections change

### ✅ Three-View Mode System
1. **AI Processor** - Paste text, select model, process
2. **Editor** - Edit sections, customize triggers
3. **Presenter** - Full-screen presentation mode

### ✅ Enhanced Features
- **Multi-trigger matching** - Section advances on ANY selected trigger
- **Keyboard shortcut maintained** - Press P to toggle armed/paused
- **Debug panel** - Shows current mode, view, triggers, stream status
- **Responsive UI** - Works on all screen sizes

### ✅ Playwright Visual Testing
- **Headed mode enabled** - Browser opens visibly for testing
- **Video recording** - All tests captured
- **Screenshots** - On every test
- **New test suite:**
  - AI processor interface tests
  - Model selector dropdown tests
  - View mode navigation tests
  - Visual regression tests

## How It Works

### User Flow

```
1. Open VerbaDeck
   ↓
2. Paste raw script text
   ↓
3. Select AI model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet recommended)
   ↓
4. Click "Process with AI" (30-60 seconds)
   ↓
5. AI returns formatted sections with suggested triggers
   ↓
6. Switch to "Edit Sections" view
   ↓
7. Click words to customize triggers
   ↓
8. Use "AI Suggest" for better ideas
   ↓
9. Click "Start Presenting"
   ↓
10. Say wake word ("majin twin") to ARM
   ↓
11. Speak naturally - sections auto-advance on trigger words
   ↓
12. Visual flash + slide animation on each advance
```

### AI Processing Example

**Input (raw text):**
```
I'm excited to introduce VerbaDeck today. We've solved a major problem
in presentations. People struggle with clickers and timing. Our solution
uses voice recognition. Just speak naturally and advance automatically.
The market is huge with millions of presentations daily.
```

**Output (AI-processed sections):**
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "content": "I'm excited to introduce VerbaDeck today. We've solved a major problem in presentations.",
      "primaryTrigger": "presentations",
      "alternativeTriggers": ["VerbaDeck", "problem"]
    },
    {
      "content": "People struggle with clickers and timing. Our solution uses voice recognition.",
      "primaryTrigger": "recognition",
      "alternativeTriggers": ["solution", "voice"]
    },
    {
      "content": "Just speak naturally and advance automatically. The market is huge with millions of presentations daily.",
      "primaryTrigger": "daily",
      "alternativeTriggers": ["automatically", "market"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Keys Configuration

### AssemblyAI (Voice Recognition)
```
AAI_API_KEY=987aca52da654f01aad3113ecb062169
```

### OpenRouter (AI Processing)
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
```

**Security Note:** Both keys are in `.env` and `.gitignore` prevents them from being committed.

## Running VerbaDeck

### Start Both Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server (port 3001)
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Client (port 5173)
cd client
npm run dev

# Or run both together:
npm run dev
```

### Run Playwright Tests (with Visual Feedback)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Product Pitch

**Paste this into AI Processor:**
```
We're building the future of presentations. No more fumbling with clickers
or losing your place. VerbaDeck uses advanced voice recognition to advance
slides automatically. You just speak naturally and the system handles the rest.

The problem is massive. Over 30 million presentations happen every day and
most presenters struggle with timing and technology. Our solution changes that.

We've already tested with 500 beta users and they report 40% better engagement.
The feedback has been incredible. Now we're ready to scale to millions of users.
```

**AI Output:** 3 sections with smart trigger words automatically selected.

### Example 2: Technical Talk

**Paste this:**
```
Today I want to share our new architecture. We rebuilt the entire system from
scratch using modern microservices. The performance improvement is dramatic.

Let me explain the key components. We have an API gateway that handles routing.
Behind that are 12 independent services. Each service has its own database.

The results speak for themselves. Response times dropped by 80 percent. Our
uptime is now 99.99 percent. Users love the new speed and reliability.
```

**AI Output:** Well-structured technical sections with appropriate triggers.

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to API"

**Solution:** Check that server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/models
```

Should return list of AI models.

### "AI processing takes forever"

**Solution:**
- Try Claude 3 Haiku (fastest model)
- Check your OpenRouter account has credits
- Verify API key is correct in `.env`

### "TypeScript errors"

**Solution:**
```bash
cd client
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Should compile with no errors (verified).

### "Framer Motion animations not smooth"

**Solution:**
- Disable hardware acceleration if needed
- Check browser supports Framer Motion (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Reduce complexity if on older hardware
