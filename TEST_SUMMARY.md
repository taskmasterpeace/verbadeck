## Test Failures Analysis

### Expected Failures (Not Bugs)

**Category 1: Unimplemented UI Features (6 failures)**
- Target audience selector not in CreateFromScratch component
- Image toggle switch not fully implemented
- Image upload grid needs target audience selector first

**Category 2: Old Test References (5 failures)**
- Tests reference "AI Processor" (renamed to "Process Existing Content")
- Need to update these test selectors

**Category 3: Strict Mode Violations (10 failures)**
- Multiple elements match same selector (e.g., "Recommended" text)
- Character counter "0 characters" appears twice
- Icons like ✨ appear in multiple locations
- **Solution**: Use more specific selectors (`.first()`, parent context)

**Category 4: Presenter View Tests (11 failures)**
- Some tests assume default script is loaded
- Tests for features in presenter mode need sections generated first
- **Solution**: Mock or generate sections before these tests
