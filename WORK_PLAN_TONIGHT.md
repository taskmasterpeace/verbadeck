# VerbaDeck Work Plan - Tonight's Tasks
**Created:** January 31, 2025, 1:45 AM
**Status:** PLANNING COMPLETE - Ready to Execute
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

---

## Executive Summary

You're going to sleep. I'm going to work. When you wake up, these things will be done:

1. ✅ AI model selector simplified (best free model pre-selected)
2. ✅ Word-for-word preservation mode added
3. ✅ Real pitch data tested (your 8-section TalkAdvantage pitch)
4. ✅ UI layout audited with suggestions
5. ✅ `.env` file security verified
6. ✅ Full Playwright test with screenshots

---

## Problem Analysis

### Current Issues:
1. **Model selector takes too much space** - 50+ models in dropdown, overwhelming
2. **No word-for-word option** - AI may edit user's carefully crafted text
3. **Layout needs audit** - "Selected AI Model" section is too prominent
4. **Need real-world testing** - Your pitch is perfect test data (8 sections, 380 words)
5. **`.env` exposure risk** - Need to verify it's truly ignored by git

---

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. **Model Selector Simplification**

**Current State:**
- Dropdown with 50+ models
- User has to research which is best/free
- Takes up significant space

**New Approach - Option A (Recommended):**
```
🤖 AI Processing Mode
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● Smart (Free) - Llama 4 Scout      │
│ ○ Fast (Free) - Mistral Small 3.1   │
│ ○ Premium - Claude 3.5 Sonnet       │
│ ○ Advanced - Custom model...        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Only show 3-4 pre-selected options
- "Advanced" expands to full list if needed
- Default to best free model

**New Approach - Option B (Minimal):**
```
Processing with: Llama 4 Scout (Free) [Change]
```
- Just show current model
- Click [Change] to see full list
- Even more space efficient

**Recommendation:** Option A - gives users choice without overwhelm

---

### 2. **Word-for-Word Preservation Mode**

**User Need:**
- Pitch decks are carefully worded
- Every word matters for timing/impact
- Don't want AI changing "While you're still in the room" to "When you're in the meeting"

**Solution - Add checkbox:**
```
┌─ Processing Options ──────────────────┐
│ ☑ Preserve exact wording              │
│   (AI will only add trigger words,     │
│    not edit your content)              │
│                                        │
│ ☐ Let AI improve clarity               │
│   (AI may rephrase for better flow)    │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**
- Modify OpenRouter prompt based on checkbox
- Preserve mode: "DO NOT edit the user's text. Only identify natural trigger words from the existing content."
- Improve mode: (current behavior)

---

### 3. **Layout Audit & Improvements**

**Current Issues Identified:**

**Issue #1: Model selector dominates screen**
```
Before:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Select AI Model                        │  ← Takes 1/3 of screen
│  [Anthropic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet    ▼]   │
│  [Long description about Claude...]     │
│                                         │
│  Raw Script Text                        │  ← Only 1/3 left for actual work
│  [Small textarea]                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

After:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Mode: Smart (Free) [Change]            │  ← One line
│                                         │
│  Raw Script Text                        │  ← 2/3 of screen for work
│  [Large textarea]                       │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Issue #2: Button placement**
Current: "Process with AI" button is at bottom, requires scrolling
Fix: Make it sticky or move to top-right

**Issue #3: Character counter**
Current: Shows "0 characters" even when text exists
Fix: Update real-time, show helpful limits (Max: 50,000)

**Issue #4: Tips section**
Current: Takes space, always visible
Fix: Collapse by default, show on first use only

---

### 4. **Real Pitch Data Testing**

**Test Data:** Your TalkAdvantage Pro pitch (provided)
- 8 sections
- 380 words total
- 2:28 speaking time
- Carefully crafted with specific emphasis points

**Tests to Run:**

**Test 1: Preserve Mode**
- Input: Full pitch verbatim
- Mode: Preserve exact wording
- Expected: 8 sections, zero text changes, trigger words from existing text
- Verify: "While you're still in the room" stays exactly as-is

**Test 2: Improve Mode**
- Input: Same pitch
- Mode: Let AI improve clarity
- Expected: 8 sections, potentially rephrased, optimized triggers
- Compare: Which is better for your use case?

**Test 3: Timing Check**
- Does it preserve section boundaries?
- Are sections the right length for speaking?
- Do trigger words make sense for voice navigation?

## Potential Issues & Mitigations

### **Issue 1: API rate limits**
- **Risk:** OpenRouter free models have rate limits
- **Mitigation:** Test with smaller sections first, document any errors

### **Issue 2: Preservation mode not working**
- **Risk:** AI might still edit despite prompt
- **Mitigation:** Try multiple prompt variations, compare outputs

### **Issue 3: Layout changes break mobile**
- **Risk:** Simplifying UI might not work on small screens
- **Mitigation:** Test responsive design, use Tailwind breakpoints

### **Issue 4: Model performance differences**
- **Risk:** Free model might be noticeably worse than Claude
- **Mitigation:** Document quality differences, provide upgrade path

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Model selector uses <20% of screen space** (vs current 40%)
✅ **Preservation mode maintains 100% of original text** (zero edits)
✅ **Your 8-section pitch processes correctly** (preserves structure)
✅ **UI improvements reduce clutter by 50%** (subjective but measurable)
✅ **`.env` file confirmed secure** (not in git)
✅ **Full test documented with screenshots** (evidence of working)
