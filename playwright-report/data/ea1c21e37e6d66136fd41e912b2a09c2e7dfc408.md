The model supports up to 128 K tokens of context and emphasizes efficient reasoning through an “Evolutionary Chain-of-Thought (Evo-CoT)” training strategy. Pre-trained on more than 20 trillion reasoning-dense tokens, Ling-1T achieves strong results across code generation, mathematics, and logical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency. It employs FP8 mixed-precision training, MoE routing with QK normalization, and MTP layers for compositional reasoning stability. The model also introduces LPO (Linguistics-unit Policy Optimization) for post-training alignment, enhancing sentence-level semantic control. Ling-1T can perform complex text generation, multilingual reasoning, and front-end code synthesis with a focus on both functionality and aesthetics.

It’s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (“Puzzle”) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality. In internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10–25.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit “reasoning on/off” modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.

Finetuned from Mistral Small 3.1 and released under the Apache 2.0 license, it features a 128k token context window and supports both Mistral-style function calling and XML output formats. Designed for agentic coding workflows, Devstral Small 1.1 is optimized for tasks such as codebase exploration, multi-file edits, and integration into autonomous development agents like OpenHands and Cline. It achieves 53.6% on SWE-Bench Verified, surpassing all other open models on this benchmark, while remaining lightweight enough to run on a single 4090 GPU or Apple silicon machine. The model uses a Tekken tokenizer with a 131k vocabulary and is deployable via vLLM, Transformers, Ollama, LM Studio, and other OpenAI-compatible runtimes.

                    - generic [ref=e939]: MiniMax-M1 is a large-scale, open-weight reasoning model designed for extended context and high-efficiency inference. It leverages a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture paired with a custom "lightning attention" mechanism, allowing it to process long sequences—up to 1 million tokens—while maintaining competitive FLOP efficiency. With 456 billion total parameters and 45.9B active per token, this variant is optimized for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Trained via a custom reinforcement learning pipeline (CISPO), M1 excels in long-context understanding, software engineering, agentic tool use, and mathematical reasoning. Benchmarks show strong performance across FullStackBench, SWE-bench, MATH, GPQA, and TAU-Bench, often outperforming other open models like DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B.

Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications. DeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *\"deep thinking\"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. System Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering.

                    - generic [ref=e1198]: Llama Guard 4 is a Llama 4 Scout-derived multimodal pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. Similar to previous versions, it can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM—generating text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated. Llama Guard 4 was aligned to safeguard against the standardized MLCommons hazards taxonomy and designed to support multimodal Llama 4 capabilities. Specifically, it combines features from previous Llama Guard models, providing content moderation for English and multiple supported languages, along with enhanced capabilities to handle mixed text-and-image prompts, including multiple images. Additionally, Llama Guard 4 is integrated into the Llama Moderations API, extending robust safety classification to text and images.

It supports tool use and demonstrates competitive reasoning and coding performance across benchmarks like AIME (99.5% with Python) and SWE-bench, outperforming its predecessor o3-mini and even approaching o3 in some domains. Despite its smaller size, o4-mini exhibits high accuracy in STEM tasks, visual problem solving (e.g., MathVista, MMMU), and code editing. It is especially well-suited for high-throughput scenarios where latency or cost is critical. Thanks to its efficient architecture and refined reinforcement learning training, o4-mini can chain tools, generate structured outputs, and solve multi-step tasks with minimal delay—often in under a minute.

Unlike earlier Shisa releases, this version avoids tokenizer modifications or extended pretraining. Shisa V2 70B achieves leading Japanese task performance across a wide range of custom and public benchmarks, including JA MT Bench, ELYZA 100, and Rakuda. It supports a 128K token context length and integrates smoothly with inference frameworks like vLLM and SGLang. While it inherits safety characteristics from its base model, no additional alignment was applied. The model is intended for high-performance bilingual chat, instruction following, and translation tasks across JA/EN.

Notes on Pricing ([Source](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing#detailed-pricing-breakdown-for-sonar-deep-research)) - Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches) - Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step. - Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens

                    - generic [ref=e2191]: Phi-3.5 models are lightweight, state-of-the-art open models. These models were trained with Phi-3 datasets that include both synthetic data and the filtered, publicly available websites data, with a focus on high quality and reasoning-dense properties. Phi-3.5 Mini uses 3.8B parameters, and is a dense decoder-only transformer model using the same tokenizer as [Phi-3 Mini](/models/microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct). The models underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures. When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.
